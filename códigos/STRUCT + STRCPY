STRUCT IS A DATA STRUCTURE WHERE WE CAN STORE GROUP OF DATA TYPES. YES VERY SIMILAR TO A CLASS IN JAVA. FIRST WE DECLARE THE ATRIBUTES AS I DID IN THE CODE BELOW SO
CHAR NAME, CHAR MAJOR ETC BASICALLY EVERYTHING OUR "OBJECT" WILL HAVE AND INSIDE OF THE MAIN WE WILL CREATE AN INSTANCE OF THAT STRUCT ("class") USING FOR EXAMPLE
struct Student student1;
AND THEN ADD THE ATRIBUTES LIKE student1.age = 22;
BUTTT WHEN WE WANNA ADD IT TO A STRING WE NEED TO ADD A strcpy BEFORE AND PUT THE OBJECTS NAME + ATRIBUTES INSIDE OF A PARENTHESIS !!!
THAT WOULD BE LIKE strcpy(student1.name, "Laura");



#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>


// struct sintaxe: struct + name of the strcut with capital letter
struct Student{

char name[50];
char major[50];
int age;
double gpa;


}; //yes even tho it has the curly bracket we have to put a semicolon to end a struct
int main()
{

   struct Student student1;
   student1.age = 22;
   student1.gpa = 3.2;
   strcpy(student1.name, "Laura");
      strcpy(student1.major, "Computer Science");
   /*
   first you need to add strcpy then (instance + adress, "info you wanna add")
   so like strcpy(student1 is the instance and name is the adress of the atribute, and "Laura" is the info we want to add to this instance.
*/

printf("Your grade is: %f\n", student1.gpa);

printf("Your age is: %d\n", student1.age);

printf("Your name is: %s\n", student1.name);

printf("Your major is: %s\n", student1.major);
  return 0;
}
